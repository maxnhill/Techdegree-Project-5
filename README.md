# Techdegree-Project-5

Description:

This project is a web application that showcases a list of programming projects. The website has a homepage that displays a list of all the projects, an "About Me" page that provides some information about the creator of the website, and a "Project Detail" page for each project that provides a description and a link to the project's GitHub repository.

The website also has functionality for adding new projects, editing existing ones, and deleting them. When a user adds a new project, they can enter the project's title, description, and GitHub repository URL. The website stores this information in a database and adds the new project to the homepage.
